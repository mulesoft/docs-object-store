= Object Store v2 REST APIs 

include::reuse::partial$non-inclusive-banner.adoc[]

The Object Store v2 APIs enable you to use REST to perform the following:

* Retrieve a list of object stores and keys associated with an application.
* Store and retrieve key-value pairs in an object store.
* Delete key-value pairs from an object store.
* Retrieve Object Store usage statistics for your organization.

Object Store provides these APIs:

+
To get the bearer token, you need the client ID and client secret for the app.


=== Get the Client ID and Client Secret for the App 

To get the client ID and the client secret for the app:

. Log in to *Anypoint Platform > Runtime Manager*.
. Click an application and click *Manage Application*.
. If the app is not associated with Object Store, click *Use Object Store v2* and apply changes.
. Click *Object Store* in the left navigation area, and then click *Show Client Credentials*.
. Click *Copy to Clipboard* for *Client ID* and save it as the value of CLIENT_ID.
. Click *Copy to Clipboard* for *Client Secret* and save it as the value of CLIENT_SECRET.


== Object Store v2 API  

The Object Store v2 API reads and writes `key,list` values, 
which is different from Anypoint Connector for Object Store (Object Store Connector),
which reads and writes in the `key,value` format.

The following table compares the Object Store REST API operations to Object Store Connector operations:

[%header,cols="20a,50a,30a"]
|===
|Object Store v2 API |Object Store v2 REST API Operations |Object Store Connector Operation

|POST a|

* Object Store
+
** Object store TTL, in seconds
+
The maximum TTL is 2592000 seconds (30 days).
+
If the `entryTtl` value specified is greater than 30 days, the value defaults to 2592000 seconds (30 days), without returning an error.
** Persistence property
** Usage limits for each application or environment, including options for limits based on keys or size, and how to enforce them
* Key and list (item) value
|Store
|GET |

* Get keys
* Get item
* Get items
* Get all items
* Get regions for an organization

|Contains + Retrieve + Retrieve all keys + Retrieve and store (Retrieve part)
|PUT |

* Put item as string
* Put item as number
* Put item as confirmable string
* Put store

|Store
|DELETE |

* Remove object store
* Delete key
* Delete item

|Remove
|===


You can retrieve a maximum of 25 keys with each GET operation.

=== Limitations 

If an application writes to an object store using the REST interface and reads with 
Object Store Connector for Mule 3 from the same key, the read can retrieve only the value at element 0. 
Therefore, when using the REST API, use the API to write and read content
from the object store.
Alternatively, you can use the API to write only to index 0.

This limitation doesn't apply to Object Store Connector for Mule 4 or
Anypoint Studio Object Store Connector.


=== Access the Object Store v2 API

. Set up an application, such as Postman, to access the object store.
. Configure the object store access URL, replacing ORG_ID with your organization ID and 
ENV_ID with your environment ID:
+
--
`BASE_URL/api/v1/organizations/ORG_ID/environments/ENV_ID/stores/myTestStoreId/objects`

Depending on the deployment region, use one of the following domains for the value of BASE_URL in the access URL:

[%header,cols="15,75a,10a"]
|===

== Object Store v2 Stats API 

The Object Store v2 Stats API enables you to retrieve statistics on your Object Store usage.

The usage statistics are not real-time and might include latency.

Use the Stats API to view your entire organization's usage of Object Store for billing purposes:

* Usage per root organization and all sub-organizations
* Usage per organization
* Usage per environment
* Usage per region
* Usage per store

=== Access the Object Store v2 Stats API

. Set up an application, such as Postman, to access the object store.
. Configure the access URL, replacing ORG_ID with your organization ID and 
ENV_ID with your environment ID:
+
`+https://object-store-stats.anypoint.mulesoft.com/api/v1/organizations/ORG_ID/environments/ENV_ID?startDate=...&endDate=...&period=...+`
. Configure the application with HTTP headers and body for values to store to or read from
the object store.
. Send the operation to the Object Store v2 Stats API.
