Object Store v2 lets CloudHub applications store data and states across batch processes, Mule components and applications, from within an application.

You can select Object Store v2 as the implementation for Mule 3 and Mule 4 in CloudHub by checking the *Object Store V2* checkbox in Runtime Manager at deployment time. See the xref:osv2-faq.adoc[FAQ] for Object Store information.

On-premise Mule applications cannot use Object Store v2.

Object Store v2 features:

* Persists keys for 30 days unless updated. If a key is updated, the TTL (time-to-live) is extended by another 30 days. For more information, see xref:osv2-faq.adoc#how-long-can-data-persist-in-object-store-v2[How long can data persist in Object Store v2?]

* Allows for an unlimited number of entries. There is no limit on the total size of v2 object-stores.
* Stores values up to 10 MB (when Base64 encoded) in size. You can estimate base64 size of a payload as follows: CEILING(base10size * 1024/3) * 4, where base10size is object size in bytes.
+ Example: A base10 payload size of 7.5 MB converts to 10.24 MB base64.
+
* Is available in all supported regions and availability zones within each region.
* Is co-located in the same region as your workers. For example, workers hosted in Singapore would use Object Store v2  hosted in Singapore.
* Provides a Mule connector and REST interface for access by external applications.
* Provides end-to-end secure TLS-transport.
* Encrypts persistent storage to FIPS 140-2 compliant standards.


You can use the existing Object Store connector to write to the object store, regardless of whether you are using v1 or v2.

The Object Store v2 user interface is available in the Anypoint Platform > Runtime Manager.

== Upgrade to Object Store v2

* Back up all the data in your current object store.
+
IMPORTANT: Data does not carry over from Object Store v1 to v2.  Any data in a v1 object store, including watermarks and other Mule component states, does not move to v2. If you revert to Object Store v1, your Object Store v1 data is still there.
+
* To access Object Store v2, in Anypoint Platform, click *Runtime Manager*. Click the name of your application to view the application's dashboard, and click *Manage Application*. In the *Settings* screen, click *Use Object Store v2*. Accept the prompt. The *Application Data* section of the Runtime Manager's dashboard changes to *Object Store*.

== Object Store Notes

* For Object Store v2 region availability see xref:osv2-faq.adoc#where-is-object-store-v2-available[Where is Object Store v2 available?]
* The Object Store Connector works for both Object Store version 1 and 2.
* Object Store v2 enforces a maximum data persistence of 30 days from time of creation.
* The free Object Store v2 limits usage to 10 transactions per second (TPS) per application.
+
Premium add-on users are allowed up to 100 TPS per app.
+
To increase your TPS limit, contact the MuleSoft account team.

* For CloudHub applications using Mule 4, if you choose Object Store v2, Object Store v2 overrides the `_defaultPersistentObjectStore` object store.
+
For CloudHub applications using Mule 3, Object Store v2 overrides the `_defaultUserObjectStore` object store. To use Object Store v2 in Mule 3 CloudHub applications, set the Object Store reference field to the `_defaultUserObjectStore` value.
