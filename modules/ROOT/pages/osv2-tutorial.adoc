= Tutorial: Store and Retrieve Data from Object Store v2

Use this tutorial to configure Anypoint Connector for Object Store (Object Store Connector) in your app so that you can use Object Store v2 to store and view data.

You can send any serializable data as key-value pairs to the object store.


In this tutorial, you:

. <<create-app-studio7,Create a Mule 4.x app in Anypoint Studio 7.x>> and configure Object Store Connector for Mule 4 in the app.
+
You then test your app by sending data to the object store and viewing it in Runtime Manager.
. Optionally, <<create-app-studio6,create a Mule 3.9 app in Anypoint Studio 6.x>>, configure Object Store Connector for Mule 3, and test the connection.

== Before You Begin

Before you begin this tutorial, you must have:

* Familiarity with Anypoint Studio, Anypoint Platform, and Runtime Manager
* An https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint Platform account]
+
If you don't have an Anypoint Platform login, click *Sign up* on the Anypoint Platform sign-in page.
* Anypoint Studio installed on your system:
+
** xref:studio::to-download-and-install-studio.adoc[Studio 7.x]
** xref:6.x@studio::to-download-and-install-studio.adoc[Studio 6.x]
* A https://curl.haxx.se[`curl` command line tool^] for testing 
+
This tutorial uses the HTTP Listener trigger to initiate Object Store Connector access and a `curl` command to send JSON data to your Mule app.
+
Instead of `curl`, you can use Postman or browser plugins.

You have successfully used Studio 7 to configure an app with an object store.
Next, you test the connection by submitting REST API commands to the Object Store API and using Runtime Manager to view the results.

[[test-app-studio7]]
=== Test Your Studio 7.x Application

After you create your app in Studio 7, you can test it using a `curl` command to submit a REST API command to the Object Store API.
Then, use Runtime Manager to view the results.

To test your app:

. In Runtime Manager, click *Applications* and ensure that the `osv2-demo` app is running.
. Click the *Status* column for the `osv2-demo` app to display its details.
. Copy the *App url* value:
+
image::os-tutorial-rtm-deploy-url.png[App url in Runtime Manager]
. From the command line, run the following `curl` command, replacing _APP-URL_ with the *App url* value that you copied from Runtime Manager: 
+
[source,console]
----
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "key": "myKey", "value": "OSv2 Test" }' "http://APP-URL/store";echo
----
+
The output from this command displays the key-value pair that you sent to the object store:
+
[source,console]
----
{ "key": "myKey", "value": "OSv2 Test" }
----
+
. In Runtime Manager, click *Manage application* in the details pane for the application:
+
image::os-tutorial-rtm-manage-app.png[Manage application in the details pane]
. Select *Object Store* from the sidebar.
. Click the object store, the partition, and then the key:
+
image::os-tutorial-rtm-key-in-os.png[Object Store option, key, and value in Runtime Manager]
+
The `myKey` key that you sent from `curl` appears in the object store with the value of `[binary value] BINARY`.
The value is binary because Mule 4 wraps values in a Mule object, which causes
them to be visible only as binary in Anypoint Platform.
. From the command line, run the following `curl` command to view the value for the key, replacing _APP-URL_ with the *App url* value that you copied from Runtime Manager:
+
[source,console]
----
curl http://APP-URL/retrieve?key=myKey;echo
----
+
The output from this command displays the value for the key:
+
[source,console]
----
"OSv2 Test"
----

You have successfully tested your app using a `curl` command to store and retrieve a key-value pair in the object store and viewed the results in Runtime Manager.

=== Example App XML for Studio 7.x

You can use XML to create the `osv2-demo` app in Studio 7 by clicking *Configuration XML* tab in Studio,
comparing your XML to the following, and making corrections as needed:
