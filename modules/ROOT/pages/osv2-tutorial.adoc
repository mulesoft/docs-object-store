= Tutorial: Object Store v2
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

Use this tutorial to begin using Object Store v2 to store and view data.

You can send any serializable data as key-value pairs to the object store.


In this tutorial, you create two apps, one in Design Center and one in Anypoint Studio:

. Configure Anypoint Connector for Object Store (Object Store Connector) in the app.
. Send data to the object store.
. View data in Runtime Manager.

Depending on your Mule version, you create your app in Studio 7 (Mule 4) or Studio 6 (Mule 3).



== Prerequisites

* Familiarity with Anypoint Studio, Anypoint Platform, and Runtime Manager
* An xref::anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint Platform account]
+
If you don't have an Anypoint Platform login, click *Sign up* on the Anypoint Platform sign-in page.
* A Design environment configured in Anypoint Platform *Access Management > Environments*.
+
If you don't see *Access Management*, contact your site administrator.
* Anypoint Studio installed on your system:
+
--
** Studio 7 
+
See xref:studio::to-download-and-install-studio.adoc[Downloading and Installing Anypoint Studio].
** Studio 6 
+
See xref:6@studio::to-download-and-install-studio.adoc[Downloading and Installing Anypoint Studio].
--
* A https://curl.haxx.se[`curl`] command for testing 
+
This tutorial uses the HTTP Listener trigger to initiate Object Store Connector access and a `curl` command to send JSON data to your Mule app.
+
Instead of `curl`, you can use Postman or browser plugins.

Disable password programs such as LastPass or Okta in your browser before using Design Center.
If enabled, the password program inserts passwords in fields in Design Center, which can cause the app to fail. 

== Create an App with an Object Store in Design Center

You use Design Center to configure an app that includes an HTTP Listener trigger and Object Store Connector.
Then, you can use a `curl` command to send a key and value, and view the key in Runtime Manager.

To configure an app in Design Center:

. In *Anypoint Platform*, click *Design Center* in the left navigation bar or the main Anypoint Platform screen.
. Click *Create new* > *Create new application*:
+
.The arrow shows the *Create new application* option.
image::os-tutorial-dc-create-app.png[Create new application option]

+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the *Path* value and (*2*) the close button (*X*).
image::os-tutorial-dc-http-path.png[Path value and close button (X)]
+
Because the default settings for HTTP Listener are correct, you don't need to click *Edit*.
. Click the plus icon (*+*) to the right of the HTTP Listener trigger:
+
.The arrow shows the plus icon (+).
image::os-tutorial-dc-plus-icon.png[Plus icon]
+
. In the *Select a component* window, enter `ob` to search for ObjectStore Connector:
+
.The arrow shows ObjectStore Connector.
image::os-tutorial-dc-os-search.png[Search for ObjectStore Connector]
+
. Click the connector and then click the *Store* operation:
+

image::os-tutorial-dc-running.png[The osv2demo app running in a temporary environment]

You have successfully used Design Center to configure and deploy an app with an object store to a temporary environment.

Next, you test the connection by submitting REST API commands to the Object Store API and using Runtime Manager to view the results.

=== Test Your Design Center App

After you create your app in Design Center, you test your app using a `curl` command to submit a REST API command to the Object Store API and use Runtime Manager to view the results.

To test your app:

. Click the copy icon to copy the deployment URL:
+
.The arrow shows the deployment URL copy icon.
image::os-tutorial-dc-copy-link.png[The copy deployment URL icon]
. From the command line, use `curl` command to send a key-value pair to the object store, replacing _DEPLOYMENT-URL_ with the deployment URL you copied from Design Center:
+
[source,json,linenums]
----

curl -X POST \
  "http://DEPLOYMENT-URL/store"
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" 
  -d '{ "key": "myKey", "value": "OSv2 Test" }' 

----
+
The output from this command is:
+
[source,console]
----
{ "key": "myKey", "value": "OSv2 Test" }
----
. Select *View in Runtime Manager* from the *...* menu in the right corner:
+
.The arrow shows the *...* menu and *View in Runtime Manager* option in Design Center.
image::os-tutorial-dc-view-rtm-option.png[View in Runtime Manager menu option]
. In *Runtime Manager*, click *Object Store* in the left navigation pane.
. Click the object store, the partition, and then the key:
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the object store, (*2*) the key, and (*3*) the value in the object store.
image::os-tutorial-rtm-key-in-os.png[Key and value in the object store in Runtime Manager]
+
You see that the `myKey` key that you sent from `curl` appears in the object store with the value of `[binary value] BINARY`.
+
The `myKey` key that you sent from `curl` appears in the object store with the value of `[binary value] BINARY`.
The value is binary because Mule 4 wraps values in a Mule object, which causes
them to be visible only as binary in Anypoint Platform.

You have successfully tested your app using a `curl` command to store a key-value pair in the object store and viewed the results in Runtime Manager.

To verify that the value is correct, return to Design Center and add a new flow that retrieves the value.




=== Create a Flow to Retrieve the Value

To create a new flow to retrieve the 'myKey` value:

. In Design Center, in the *Project* area on the left, expand the *Flows* menu.
. Select *Rename* from the vertical ellipsis menu and rename your existing flow from `New Flow` to `Store`:
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the vertical ellipsis menu and (*2*) the *Rename* option.
+
image::os-tutorial-dc-rename-flow.png[Vertical ellipsis menu and Rename option]

. In the wizard, click *Go straight to canvas*:
+
.The arrow shows the *Go straight to canvas* option.
image::os-tutorial-dc-goto-canvas.png[Go straight to canvas option]
+
. Click the *Trigger* box and enter `H` to search for HTTP Listener:
+
.The arrow shows the HTTP Listener.  
image::os-tutorial-dc-http-search.png[Search for HTTP Listener]
+
. Click *HTTP Listener*.
. In the *HTTP Listener* window, set the value of *Path* to `/retrieve` and then click the close button (*X*):
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the *Path* value and (*2*) the close button (*X*).
image::os-tutorial-dc-http-retrieve-path.png[Path value and close button (X)]
+
Because the default settings for HTTP Listener are correct, you don't need to click *Edit*.
. Rename this new flow to `Retrieve`.
. Click the plus icon (+) to the right of the HTTP Listener trigger to add Object Store Connector.
. In the *Select a component* window, enter `ob` to search for ObjectStore Connector:
+
.The arrow shows ObjectStore Connector.
image::os-tutorial-dc-os-search.png[Search for Object Store Connector]
+
. Click the connector and then click the *Retrieve* operation.
. In the *Configuration* tab, specify `#[attributes.queryParams.key]` in the *Key* field:
+
.The arrow shows the *Key* field in the *Retrieve* configuration.
image::os-tutorial-dc-retrieve-values.png[Key field for the Retrieve operation]

. Click *Test* to run the app in a temporary location.
. Click the copy icon to copy the deployment URL:
+
.The arrow shows the deployment URL copy icon.
image::os-tutorial-dc-copy-link.png[The copy deployment URL icon]
. From the command line, run the following `curl` command to retrieve the key, replacing _DEPLOYMENT-URL_ with the deployment URL that you copied from Design Center:
+
[source,console]
----
curl http://DEPLOYMENT-URL/retrieve?key=myKey;echo
----
+
The output from this command displays the value for the `myKey`:
+
[source,console]
----
"OSv2 Test"
