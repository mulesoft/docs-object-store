= Rate Limiting and Billing

Object Store v2 uses two metrics to determine billing and rate-limiting:

API Requests::
API requests are HTTP transactions, such as GET, PUT, and POST.
+
Object Store uses API requests to calculate transactions per second (TPS) for rate limiting.
+
See <<rate-limiting>>.

Effective API Requests::
Effective API requests are the units that Object Store uses to calculate billing.
+
One API request could generate many effective API requests.
+
See <<how-billing-is-calculated>>.

[[rate-limiting]]
== Rate Limiting

Every API request (via the connector or API) to Object Store v2 counts toward the TPS limit, based on your subscription type:

[%header,cols="50,50"]
|===
|Subscription Type|TPS Limit
|Base subscription|10 TPS per store
|Premium add-on subscription|100 TPS per store
|===

For example, if your app retrieves 1500 keys from an object store with a page size of 25:

* With the base subscription, the response is throttled over 6 seconds.
* With the premium subscription, the response is not throttled.

If the store exceeds the number of TPS allotted based on the subscription type,
Object Store v2 returns a `429 HTTP Error` response, indicating that it reached the rate limit.

If the store reaches the TPS limit, you can either upgrade to a premium subscription or redesign the app to send API requests more slowly.


[[how-billing-is-calculated]]
== How Billing is Calculated

Effective API requests count towards your monthly billing usage and quota.

An effective API request counts as *one or more units* against the quota,
depending on the size of the payload and the number of keys returned.

* For each API request up to 100 KB of object-payload data (if applicable) counts as one unit against the quota.
+
For example, if an app retrieves one key from an object store with a total payload size of 500KB, the request counts as five units against the quota.
+
Each 100 KB of payload data above 100 KB counts as an additional unit.
+
For example, if an app retrieves one key from an object store with a total payload size of 101KB, the operation counts as two units against the quota.
* For both the Retrieve All and Retrieve All Keys operations, the size of all key-value pairs in the object store partition counts towards billable units.
+
If an app runs a Retrieve All Keys operation to retrieve only the keys in the object store, the billable unit is based on the size of the key-value pairs, not just the keys.

* For each Store operation, such as storing new values or updating existing ones,
the size of all key-value pairs in the object store partition counts towards billable units.
+
For example, if an app inserts or updates one key in an object store with a total payload size of 500KB, the request counts as five units against the quota.
+
Each 100 KB of payload data above 100 KB counts as an additional unit.
+
For example, if an app inserts one key in an object store with a total payload size of 101KB, the operation counts as two units against the quota.

* Each DELETE API call counts as a single billable unit, including:
+
--
** Delete partition
** Delete all keys and values in the partition
** Delete key

In addition to one billable unit for the DELETE API call:

** Delete store: adds one billable unit for each deleted partition inside the store
** Delete partitions in store: adds one billable unit for each deleted partition inside the store

For example, a call to delete a store with two partitions counts as three billable units against the quota: one billable unit for each of the following:

* DELETE API call
* two partitions
--


The following table lists the maximum number of API requests per month,
based on your subscription type:

[%headers,cols="50,50"]
|===
|Subscription Type|Maximum API Requests Per Month
|Base subscription|26 million
|Premium add-on subscription|100 million per add-on subscription
|===

== Access Object Store Effective API Request Usage Charts

To view a chart that shows how many effective API requests your apps have consumed and the number of effective API requests that your subscription allows:

. Log in to Anypoint Platform.
. Click *Access Management* in the left navigation bar or the main Anypoint Platform page.
. Click *Object Store* in the *SUBSCRIPTION* section:
+
image::os-access-mgmt-subscription.png["Object Store option on the Access Management page"]
+
. Click a chart duration value of *6m* (six months, default), *1y* (one year), or *2y* (two years):
+
image::os-access-mgmt-usage-chart.png["Object Store Usage page for API requests"]
+
* (*1*) Duration value
* (*2*) Number of effective API requests per month
* (*3*) Percentage and amount of your quota that you have used
+
NOTE: If the usage is 0, the chart displays `<1%`.
* (*4*) Subscription type
+
--
** `Base 0.0` indicates the Base subscription.
** Base values greater than `0.0` indicate Premium add-on subscriptions.
--
+
Monthly billing usage information is delayed by 24 hours.
+
The circle graph changes to red as your effective API request usage approaches your quota:

In some cases, the stats for the current month might not load when the backend process updates the records.
If this happens, use the Object Store v2 Stats API
xref:osv2-apis.adoc#usage-by-org[Usage Metrics by Organization]
to query the daily usage in the current month and then add the daily usage together.
