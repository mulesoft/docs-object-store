= Use Object Store v2
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

Anypoint Object Store v2 (Object Store v2) enables you to share data and states across Mule runtime workers within a single application.

Object Store v2 is enabled by default in Mule 4 and in Anypoint Platform EU Control Plane.
In Mule 3, enable Object Store v2 from *Anypoint Platform > Runtime Manager* for applications that you want to access Object Store v2.

== Components

Object Store v2 interacts with these components:

* Anypoint Connector for Object Store (Object Store Connector)
+
Use Object Store Connector with Anypoint Studio to construct flows to write to and read from the object store.
+
Object Store Connector works with both Object Store version 1 and version 2.
+
To use Object Store v2 with Mule 4 apps, do not select an object store global element from the *Object store* menu.
If you select the object store global element, the app uses the Mule runtime object store, rather than Object Store v2.
+
* REST API
+
The Object Store v2 API enables you to create and delete objects, set TTL (time to live) for objects, and set usage limits.
+
The Object Store v2 Stats API enables you to retrieve Object Store v2 usage statistics,
such as how many API calls per month your organization makes to Object Store.

* Anypoint Runtime Manager
+
When you enable Object Store v2, the *Runtime Manager > Application Data* option changes to *Object Store*.
From the *Object Store* page, you can manage objects and their values in the object store.

=== Protect Object Store Data

Object Store v2 uses TLS for secure transport.
Data at rest is stored using FIPS 140-2-compliant encryption standards.
If you require a higher level of security, encrypt sensitive data before writing it to the object store.

== Add Object Store Connector to Your Mule 4 Project

Install Object Store Connector to add it to a Mule project:

. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Dependencies to Project*, enter `Object Store` in the search field.
. In *Available modules*, click *ObjectStore Connector - Mule 4* and click *Add*.
. Click *Finish*.

== Use Object Store Connector in an Application

. In Studio, create a simple flow such as the following:
+
--
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the *Listener* operation and (*2*) the *Store* operation in the *os-Simple-Flow* flow.

[%headers,cols="25a,75a"]
|===
|Connector |Parameters
|HTTP Listener|
*Connector configuration* = HTTP_Listener_config
*Path* = `/store`
|Object Store |
*Key* = `#[payload.key]` +
*Value* = `[payload.value]`
|===
--
. Save the application.
. Right-click the application name in *Package Explorer* and select *Anypoint Platform > Deploy to CloudHub*.
. If prompted, sign in to Anypoint Platform.
. Click *Deploy Application* and click *Open in Browser*.
. In Runtime Manager, click the *Status* column for your application.
. In the details pane, copy the *App url* address.

== Send Data to an Object Store

From a command line prompt, send JSON data to your Mule application using a `curl` command:

----
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "key": "TestKey01", "value": "Testing" }' "http://app-url/store"
----

Change `app-url` to the name you copied from *App url* in Runtime Manager. 

== View Data in an Object Store

To view data in an object store:

. In Runtime Manager, click the name of your application to view the dashboard.
. Click *Object Store* in the left navigation pane.
. Click the object store, the partition, and then the key:
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the object store, (*2*) the key, and (*3*) the value in the object store.
image::os-rtm-key-in-os.png[Object Store option, key, and value in Runtime Manager]
+
The columns show the object store name, partition name, key, and key data.
The partition groups the object store keys.
+
The `TestKey01` key that you sent from `curl` appears in the object store with the value `[binary value] BINARY`.
The value is binary because Mule 4 wraps values in a Mule object, which causes
them to be visible only as binary in Anypoint Platform.
+
. To delete a key, hover over a key name and click the trash can icon.
+
Similarly, you can delete a partition or the store itself by hovering over and clicking the trash can icon.

[NOTE]
Object Store v2 provides persistent storage of objects with a time to live (TTL) of 30 days.

The tutorial provides more detailed information about creating object stores in Mule 3 and Mule 4 applications. 

== Configure a Custom Time to Live Period

To configure a custom time to live (TTL) period for keys stored in Object Store v2:

. Create an app that uses Mule runtime engine version 4.2.1 or later.
. Configure the object store in the app.
. Select the *Store* operation in the flow and, in the properties window, click the green plus icon (+) to the right of the *Object store* field:
+
.The arrow shows the green plus icon in the properties window.

. Configure the TTL entries in the *Global Object Store Configuration* window:
+
.The arrow indicates the *Entry ttl* field in the *Global Object Store Configuration* window.
image::os-use-ttl-global-props.png[Global Object Store Configuration window]
+
[NOTE]
For Object Store v2, the *Max entries* field is not configurable.
+
* *Entry ttl* 
+
For Mule 4.2.1 and later, enter a custom TTL value of 0 through 2592000 seconds (30 days).
+
If you leave this field empty, you enable rolling TTL; if you exceed 2592000 seconds, the TTL defaults to 2592000 seconds.
+
For Mule versions earlier than 4.2.1, leaving this field empty to set the TTL to 2592000 seconds.
* *Entry ttl unit*
+
Specify the TTL time interval, such as MINUTES.
* *Expiration interval*
+
Specify how frequently to run the expiration thread.
+
Set this parameter to a positive value that is less than the *Entry ttl* value.
If this field is blank or the value is less than or equal to zero, Object Store v2 ignores *Entry ttl*. 
* *Expiration interval unit*
+
Specify the expiration interval time unit, such as MINUTES.
. Click *OK* to dismiss the window.
