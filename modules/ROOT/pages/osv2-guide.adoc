= Use Object Store v2
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

Anypoint Object Store v2 (Object Store v2) enables you to share data and states across Mule runtime workers within a single application.

Object Store v2 is enabled by default in Mule 4 and in Anypoint Platform EU Control Plane.
In Mule 3, enable Object Store v2 from *Anypoint Platform > Runtime Manager* for applications that you want to access Object Store v2.

== Components

Object Store v2 interacts with these components:

* Anypoint Connector for Object Store (Object Store Connector)
+
Use Object Store Connector with Anypoint Studio to construct flows to write to and read from the object store.
+
Object Store Connector works with both Object Store version 1 and version 2.
+
To use Object Store v2 with Mule 4 apps, ensure that you select the correct object store configuration reference from the *Object store* menu.
+
* REST API
+
The Object Store v2 API enables you to create and delete objects, set TTL (time to live) for objects, and set usage limits.
+
The Object Store v2 Stats API enables you to retrieve Object Store v2 usage statistics,
such as how many API calls per month your organization makes to Object Store.

* Anypoint Runtime Manager
+
When you enable Object Store v2, the *Runtime Manager > Application Data* option changes to *Object Store*.
From the *Object Store* page, you can manage objects and their values in the object store.

=== Protect Object Store Data

Object Store v2 uses TLS for secure transport.
Data at rest is stored using FIPS 140-2-compliant encryption standards.
If you require a higher level of security, encrypt sensitive data before writing it to the object store.

=== Synchronize Access to Object Store v2

Using Object Store v2 with multi-worker CloudHub applications might result in data discrepancies or key clashes.

To avoid these issues, use a distributed key-value store as a lock to synchronize access to Object Store v2.
For information about distributed locking in Mule runtime engine, see xref:mule-runtime::distributed-locking.adoc[Distributed Locking].


== Add Object Store Connector to Your Mule 4 Project

Install Object Store Connector to add it to a Mule project:

. In Studio, create a Mule project.
. In the *Mule Palette* view, click *(X) Search in Exchange*.
. In *Add Dependencies to Project*, enter `Object Store` in the search field.
. In *Available modules*, click *ObjectStore Connector - Mule 4* and click *Add*.

== Configure a Connected App

The Connected Apps feature enables you to integrate external applications with Anypoint Platform by providing access to external applications without sharing your user credentials.

For information about Connected Apps, see 
xref:access-management::connected-apps-overview.adoc[] and
xref:access-management::connected-apps-developers.adoc[].

To create a Connected App with object store scopes:

. Log into Anypoint Platform and select *Access Management*.
. In the Access Management navigation menu, click *Connected Apps*.
. Click *Create App*.
.. Specify a name for the app.
.. Select *App acts on its own behalf (client credentials)*.
.. Click *Add Scopes* and filter by "store".
.. Toggle the object store scopes:
+
image::os-conn-apps-scopes.png[Scopes for Object Store connected apps]
.. Click *Next* and select the business groups and environments to apply the scopes to.
.. Click *Review*.
.. Click *Add scopes* or *Cancel* to cancel your changes.
. Click *Save* or *Cancel* to cancel your changes.
. From the *Connected Apps* page, click *Copy Id* and *Copy Secret* for the app you just created.
+
Use this client ID and client secret to get the bearer token required to authenticate with the Object Store v2 API.
For information, see
xref:osv2-apis.adoc#authenticate-os-apis[Authenticate with the Object Store APIs].


=== Object Store Scopes

Object store scopes apply to all stores in the given environment.
Unless otherwise noted, these scopes apply to both object stores and Object Store v2 object stores.

Manage stores::
Allows create, read, update, and delete operations on stores.
Manage stores data:
Enables all store operations including data, partition, and confirmation APIs. 
View stores::
Reads store details.
Manage store clients::
(Object Store only) Manages all clients of a cloud store.
View store clients::
(Object Store only) Views all clients of a cloud store.
Store Metrics Viewer::
Retrieves OSv2 metrics using the Object Store v2 Stats API.


== Send Data to an Object Store

From a command line prompt, send JSON data to your Mule application using a `curl` command:

----
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "key": "TestKey01", "value": "Testing" }' "http://app-url/store"
----

Change `app-url` to the name you copied from *App url* in Runtime Manager. 

== View Data in an Object Store

To view data in an object store:

. In Runtime Manager, click the name of your application to view the dashboard.
. Click *Object Store* in the left navigation pane.
. Click the object store, the partition, and then the key:
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the object store, (*2*) the key, and (*3*) the value in the object store.
image::os-rtm-key-in-os.png[Object Store option, key, and value in Runtime Manager]
+
The columns show the object store name, partition name, key, and key data.
The partition groups the object store keys.
+
The `TestKey01` key that you sent from `curl` appears in the object store with the value `[binary value] BINARY`.
The value is binary because Mule 4 wraps values in a Mule object, which causes
them to be visible only as binary in Anypoint Platform.
+
. To delete a key, hover over a key name and click the trash can icon.
+
Similarly, you can delete a partition or the store itself by hovering over and clicking the trash can icon.
+
[IMPORTANT]
Do not delete object stores that are associated with a running app.
To prevent errors, stop the app before deleting an object store. 

The tutorial provides more detailed information about creating object stores in Mule 3 and Mule 4 applications. 

== Configure a Custom Time to Live Period

A custom time to live (TTL) period applies to the partition defined in the object store configuration.

For information how rolling TTL behaves, see xref:index.adoc#rolling-ttl[Rolling TTL].

To configure a custom TTL period for keys stored in the object store:

. Create an app that uses Mule runtime engine version 4.2.1 or later.
. Configure the object store in the app.
. Select the *Store* operation in the flow and, in the properties window, click the green plus icon (+) to the right of the *Object store* field:
+
.The arrow shows the green plus icon in the properties window.
image::os-use-ttl-props.png[Green plus icon in the properties window]
. Configure the TTL entries in the *Global Object Store Configuration* window:
+
.The arrow indicates the *Entry ttl* field in the *Global Object Store Configuration* window.
image::os-use-ttl-global-props.png[Global Object Store Configuration window]
+
[NOTE]
For Object Store v2, the *Max entries* field is not configurable.
+
* *Entry ttl* 
+
For Mule 4.2.1 and later, enter a custom TTL value of 0 through 2592000 seconds (30 days).
+
If you leave this field empty, you enable rolling TTL; if you exceed 2592000 seconds, the TTL defaults to 2592000 seconds.
+
For Mule versions earlier than 4.2.1, leave this field empty to set the TTL to 2592000 seconds.
* *Entry ttl unit*
+
Specify the TTL time interval, such as MINUTES.
* *Expiration interval*
+
Specify how frequently to run the expiration thread.
+
Set this parameter to a positive value that is less than the *Entry ttl* value.
If this field is blank or the value is less than or equal to zero, Object Store v2 ignores *Entry ttl*. 
* *Expiration interval unit*
+
Specify the expiration interval time unit, such as MINUTES.
. Click *OK* to dismiss the window.

== Create Object Store Partitions

You can use _partitions_ to associate multiple object stores with an app. 

To create partitions in Object Store v2:

. Create an app and add a Store operation to the flow.
. Configure the Store operation.
. Configure the partitions:
+
.. In the properties window, click the green plus icon (+) to the right of the *Object store* field:
+
.The arrow shows the green plus icon in the properties window.
image::os-use-ttl-props.png[Green plus icon in the properties window]
.. In the *Global Element Properties* window, click the green plus icon (+) to the right of *Configuration Reference* 
to create a global object store configuration:
+
.The arrow shows the green plus icon for the *Configuration Reference* field in the *Global Element Properties* window.
image::os-use-partition-studio7-os-global-props.png[Green plus icon for the Configuration Reference field in the Global Element Properties window]
.. Name the object store configuration and click *OK*.
.. Ensure that the correct configuration reference is selected and click *OK*.
.. Ensure that the correct object store is selected and click *OK*.
. Repeat Step 3 for each partition that you want to create.
. Deploy the app to CloudHub and send a key-value pair to the object store.
. In Runtime Manager, click *Applications*, select the app, and click *Object Store* in the left navigation pane.
. Select the object store.
+
The partitions associated with the object store appear in the *Object Store* page:
+
.The arrow shows the partitions in the *Object Store* page.
image::os-use-partitions-rtm.png[Partitions in the Object Store page]



== Deploy App with Object Store v2 Using the Mule Maven Plugin

If you are using the Mule Maven plugin version 3.4.0 or earlier
to deploy your app to CloudHub, do the following:

. Add the `<objectStoreV2>` element to your `pom.xml` project file:
+
[source,xml]
----
<cloudHubDeployment>
  ...
    <objectStoreV2>true</objectStoreV2>
  ...
</cloudHubDeployment>
----
. Select *Use Object Store v2* in the *Deploy Application* page in Runtime Manager.
